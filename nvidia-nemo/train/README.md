# Files for model training

Use this folder if you want to train a language model:

- Create a new plain text file, e.g. 'sentences.txt'
- Add your own sentences (or words) row by row
- Adjust the `train_lm.sh` script (set correct model, file names, n-gram count etc.)
- Train the model: `bash train_lm`
